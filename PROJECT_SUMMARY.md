# 🎉 Employee Sales Forecasting - Project Complete!

**Project Lead**: Emem Akpan | Data Scientist & ML Engineer

## ✅ What I Built

This is a **complete end-to-end ML deployment system** for Employee Sales Forecasting. I designed and implemented every component from scratch - from the data pipeline and feature engineering to model training and the interactive dashboard. The system is production-ready with comprehensive documentation.
